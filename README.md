## Components Needed:

1 x Uno R3 Board
1 x 1 Digital 8-Segment LED Display
8 x 330 Ohm Resistor (Optional - only needed to reduce brightness)
1 x Breadboard (Optional, used for tidiness)
9 x Wires


## Before we start:

The Digital 8-Segment LED Display is actually composed of common LED's as you can see in the schematic below. The display used in this how to is a common anode. The goal of this how to is to display the numbers 0-9 on the LED display.
